## :dart:Concluion
Our data study shows unexpected market trends that contradict the popular understanding of the  sedans domination on the roads. We've found key opportunities to improve our car selection over initial observations by carefully looking at actual sales trends and inventory turnover rates. This data-driven strategy reveals hidden opinions and possible profits that are not visible through simple observation.
